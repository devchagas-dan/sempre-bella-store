Creating my store homepage from scratch
I'm going to use Reactjs and Material UI as frontend techs
Java with SpringBoot as backend techs

## 1 - I'm gonna write a journal, describing my progress  
I've just installed npm, Material UI and TailwindCss Working on Navbar.
run to install MUI - npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
run to install MUI Icon - npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react
Important dependencies to be installed: 
### npm i @headlessui/react
### npm i @heroicons/react



## 2 - Implementing a React Alice Carousel - 
React Alice Carousel is a React component for building content galleries, content rotators and any React carousels. Source = https://maxmarinich.github.io/react-alice-carousel/#basic and https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-alice-carousel?activeTab=readme. Everything has just worked well. Next time I'll have to config Alice Carousel according to my project.  

## 3 - Creating my website banners on Canva. 
Banners have already been created and code is rendering all of them. So happy!
